At first: Visually compresses the administratrive header so that more admin page content can be initially seen. Also moves 'Dashboard' onto the main administrative menu because having it sit in the tip-top black bar was ticking me off and many other changes in the edit-area.
At second. Adminimize is a WordPress plugin that lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the WordPress administration menu, submenu and even the 'Dashboard', with forwarding to the Manage-page. On top of that, you can also hide post meta controls on the Write page and other areas in the admin-area and Write-page, so as to simplify the editing interface. All is addicted from your rights, admin (user_level 10) or not admin-rights (smaller user_level 10).
